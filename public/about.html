<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 31 year old student web developer. I have worked for the Department of Corrections for the past 5 years. I have a passion for social work and exercise.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to watch boxing, basketball, tennis, and mixed martial arts. I enjoy going to the beach, and spending time with my friends. I would like to read more books and expand my understanding of web development.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to have a successful career in web development and eventually learn the necessary skills to work in cybersecurity to prevent cybercrime.</p>
